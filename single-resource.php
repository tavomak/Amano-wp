A templates for your custom post type
====================================
If you don't create a custom template for your custom post type, then WordPress will
use "single.php". (Note, what we are talking about here are "Custom POST Types".)

Therefore what you need to do is (as I have done here in this example template):

(a) Replicate your "single.php" file, SAVEAS "single-resource.php" (in this exmple).
Note that the name of the custom post type is used, in the singular.

(b) Edit the file "single-resource.php" any way you like it. Add in some special CSS
classes (and style them in your styledheet).

(c) Create a unique LOOP (or WordPress will use the loop "includes/loops/content.php").

(d) You may also need a custome "archive-resource.php" (but I have not created one here yet).
